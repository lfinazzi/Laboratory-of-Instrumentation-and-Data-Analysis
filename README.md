# Laboratory-of-Instrumentation-and-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the example python codes provided to the students of the course "Laboratory of Instrumentation and Data Analysis", taught by me in the University of San Martin in the second semester of 2024. The course consists of a python introduction, followed by statistical data analysis (and python libraries to do so). Instrument control using pyvisa was on the course syllabus as well, and these were used to acquire real datasets that were later analyzed.

# Scripts:

  1. _SDS1102CNL+_control.py_ and _SDS1102CNL+_control_more_instructions.py_: Control scripts for SDS1102CNL+ AWG using pyvisa,
  2. _SDG810.py_: Control script example for SDG810 AWG using pyvisa,
  3. _file_io.py_: Example on how to perform file I/O,
  4. _central_limit_theorem_example.py_: Visualization on the central limit theorem using a Montecarlo simulation,
  5. _chi2_correct_distribution.py_: Visualization of the $\chi^2$ distribution when the proposed fit model for a dataset is correct,
  6. _covariance_importance.py_: Visualization of the importance of using correct parameter covariances when performing fits,
  7. _find_peaks_example.py_: Simple script to showcase scipy's find_peaks,
  8. _goodness_of_fit.py_: Example on how to calculate p-value when performing a hypothesis test on measured data,
  9. _hist_to_errorbar.py_: Script to show how to convert a histogram into an errorbar plot,
  10. _mean_error.py_: Visulaization of the correct way of calculating the error of the mean and what this value is conceptually,
  11._ ODR_fit.py_: Script that shows how to use scipy's ODR for Orthogonal Distance Regression fits,
  12. _plotting_basic_code.py_: Script that shows how to perform simple plots using matplotlib,
  13. _process_audio.py_: Example script to load and play audio using pyaudio and wave libraries,
  14. _spectrogram_examplepy_: Example script to show what is a spectrogram and how we can plot it with matplotlib,
  15. _waveform_capture.py_: Script showing how to capture waveforms using an oscilloscope.
